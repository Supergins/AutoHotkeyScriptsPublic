# AutoHotkeyScriptsPublic
My public collection of AutoHotkey scripts.

## Disclaimer
This repo is mostly ment as a way for me to share some useful scripts to frends, etc.

This is not supposed to be a general list or compilation of useful scripts for anyone to grab or look through. Feel free however to use any of the scripts inside this repo if you found them useful or even propose small changes/bugfixes if you find any.  
Do not expect me to accept new scripts to the repo since this is not it's current goal.

## How to use
Download [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) v2. Run the script you want to use. Simple enough.

---

If you need more detailed guide:
- Install AutoHotkey v2 from [this](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-v2.exe) link.
- Do one of these:
    - Download `*.ahk` script from this repo youre interested in running
    - or if you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed:
        - create a folder somewhere (can be on your desktop for ease of use) ond open it
        - type "cmd" in address bar
        - run 
            ```bash
            git clone https://link.temp
            ```
- You can now double click the script to run it. But if you wish to run it automatically on startup, then:
    - Press `Win+R` and type `shell:startup`. You are now inside user startup folder.
    - Move the script or create a shortcut and move it to said folder.
- If you wish to update the script with new version, download the new one and repeat above steps or if you used the Git method, go to the directory where you cloned the repo and type
    ```bash
    git pull
    ```

Alternativeley you can skip downloading AutoHotkey and instead use precompiled `*.exe` version of the script. The rest of the steps is the same as above.
